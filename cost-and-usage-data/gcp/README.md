Create **GCP** data with this generator.

The repo has minimal data for each (as I want to avoid getting into GitHub LFS).                      
Fork/download the repo and run the data generators.                    
Every generator has a ```DATA_VOLUME_SETTINGS``` dict that can be configured to generate more projects.                     
Each of the generators has a `_config.py` where more details about the services, the projects, account hierarchies etc. can be configured as well.

* [**Multi-Cloud** Setup (a mix of GCP, Azure and AWS)](https://github.com/shauryashaurya/FinOps-and-find-out/tree/main/cost-and-usage-data/multi) - this uses the data generators from the AWS, GCP and Azure modules. This was incredibly complex, and frankly a bit frustrating to build - I can totally relate to the FinOps teams dealing with multiple cloud based environments at the same time, esp. in large enterprises... Once this code worked, it was so much fun! :) :) :)
