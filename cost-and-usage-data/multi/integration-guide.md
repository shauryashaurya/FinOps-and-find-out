# Guide: Adding More Projects and Controlling Data Generation

This guide explains how to add the new project configurations and control the amount of data generated by the multi-cloud billing generator.

## Adding the 30 New Projects

To add the 30 additional project configurations to your existing setup:

1. Create a new file named `additional_projects.py` with the content from the "30 Additional Multi-Cloud Project Configurations" artifact
2. Import and integrate the additional projects into the main configuration:

```python
# At the top of your multi_cloud_billing_generator.py or config_multi_cloud.py file
try:
    from config_multi_cloud import MULTI_CLOUD_PROJECTS
except ImportError:
    MULTI_CLOUD_PROJECTS = {}

# Import the additional projects
try:
    from additional_projects import ADDITIONAL_PROJECTS
    # Merge the dictionaries
    MULTI_CLOUD_PROJECTS.update(ADDITIONAL_PROJECTS)
except ImportError:
    pass  # Continue with existing projects if additional projects aren't available
```

## Controlling Data Generation Volume

### Number of Projects

To control how many projects get processed:

1. Adjust the `max_projects` parameter in `DATA_VOLUME_SETTINGS`:

```python
DATA_VOLUME_SETTINGS = {
    # ... other settings
    "max_projects": 20,  # Increase this to process more projects
}
```

2. If you want to process specific projects rather than random ones, you can modify the project selection logic in the `main()` function:

```python
# To process all projects (instead of random selection)
projects_to_process = list(MULTI_CLOUD_PROJECTS.items())
max_projects = min(len(projects_to_process), DATA_VOLUME_SETTINGS["max_projects"])
projects_to_process = projects_to_process[:max_projects]

# To process specific projects by name
specific_projects = ["RetailPlatformMigration", "SmartCityMonitoring", "FinancialServicesHybrid"]
projects_to_process = [(name, MULTI_CLOUD_PROJECTS[name]) for name in specific_projects 
                      if name in MULTI_CLOUD_PROJECTS]
```

### Time Period for Data Generation

To control the time period for which data is generated:

1. Adjust the `days_to_generate` parameter in `DATA_VOLUME_SETTINGS`:

```python
DATA_VOLUME_SETTINGS = {
    "days_to_generate": 90,  # Generate 90 days of data instead of 365
    # ... other settings
}
```

2. To generate data for a specific date range rather than ending today, modify the date setting in the `main()` function:

```python
# Set specific date range
days_to_generate = DATA_VOLUME_SETTINGS["days_to_generate"]
end_date = datetime.date(2025, 3, 15)  # Set specific end date
start_date = end_date - datetime.timedelta(days=days_to_generate)
```

### Data Granularity

To control how detailed the data is:

1. Adjust the `sampling_interval` parameter:

```python
DATA_VOLUME_SETTINGS = {
    # ... other settings
    "sampling_interval": 1,  # Generate data for every day (more detailed)
    # or
    "sampling_interval": 7,  # Generate data weekly (less detailed)
}
```

### Cost Volatility

To control how much variation there is in the cost data:

```python
DATA_VOLUME_SETTINGS = {
    # ... other settings
    "volatility_factor": 0.05,  # Increase for more variation in costs
    # or
    "volatility_factor": 0.01,  # Decrease for more stable costs
}
```

## Putting It All Together

For a comprehensive example, here's how you might configure the generator for a realistic quarterly business review:

```python
DATA_VOLUME_SETTINGS = {
    "days_to_generate": 90,           # Last quarter (90 days)
    "sampling_interval": 1,           # Daily data for detailed analysis
    "on_prem_cost_simulation": True,  # Include on-prem comparison
    "volatility_factor": 0.02,        # Moderate cost variation
    "max_projects": 20,               # Process 20 projects
}
```

Or for a high-level annual overview with less detail:

```python
DATA_VOLUME_SETTINGS = {
    "days_to_generate": 365,          # Full year
    "sampling_interval": 7,           # Weekly data points
    "on_prem_cost_simulation": True,  # Include on-prem comparison
    "volatility_factor": 0.03,        # More variation for long-term trends
    "max_projects": 10,               # Focus on top 10 projects
}
```
